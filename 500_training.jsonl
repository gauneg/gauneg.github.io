{"prompt":"This article is both accurate and highly misleading. The author is correct that there is very little reliable evidence that links glutamic acid and\/or glutamate to health problems. The backlash against MSG as a result of the \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\" craze, was not rooted in scientific inquiry.\nHowever, MSG is not just a source for glutamate like seaweed and tomatoes are. MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and contains not just glutamate but also sodium ions. Having 2000mg of natural glutamate should be harmless. Having enough MSG to give you 2000mg of glutamate means you're getting a shit ton of sodium. That's not good for you, especially if you're one of the many people for whom excess sodium intake adversely affects your blood pressure. So while MSG is presumably no worse than NaCl (and is perhaps better in that the umami flavor means you don't have to use as much sodium to get an equally rich taste), to say that MSG is totally harmless without even mentioning sodium and hypertension is ridiculous. Even in terms of short term effects, I've had plenty of MSG-free hot and sour soups that made my head itch. Not from MSG but from thousands of mg of sodium found in their gratuitously added soy sauce and table salt.","completion":"You hit the nail on the head.  For most of us, it's not the MSG that causes the problem.  It's what comes with it.  For starters it's the sodium.

Python 3.4 has generic functions to do single dispatch matching on type.  You can statically type check python now (see pysonar2, pylint, and pycharm for example).  Not only as pypy made a major breakthrough with performant STM based concurrency(no threads), but threading has been improved in python 3 too.

{"prompt":"Very cool, but I sometimes worry that the illusion of safety is more dangerous than the original danger itself.\nIn Boulder, where I live, several crosswalks were identified as being particularly dangerous for pedestrians, and pedestrian crossing signs with big flashing lights were installed at these locations over the past 5 years. This spring, a report was released[1] that showed accidents at many of these crosswalks had actually increased since the lights were installed. \"Taken together, the data suggests that approximately eight additional crossing accidents per year occur at these locations,\" says the report.\nThere are lots of theories about why, but I think it boils down to one thing: when pedestrians can hit a button and light up these big signs which are supposed to make everyone stop, it makes them feel much safer, to the point that many people will hit the button and start walking almost immediately, without taking the time to make sure that all lanes of traffic are aware of their presence and stopping.\nThe prospect of automated cars scares me because, obviously, they cannot be perfect, and they will not be able to identify every dangerous driving scenario. Of course, there is a manual override, but I fear that the car being right 99% of the time will lead to such a complacency in \"drivers\" that, in the 1% of cases where the car is wrong and about to hit something, we will not be able to stop in time. The more accurate the car is, the more safe we feel, and the less likely we are to monitor it as closely and notice when it is wrong.\nAnyway, I rather hope I'm wrong.

That's much safer for both parties.\nThe \"illusion of safety\" is most dangerous at traffic lights. 2-3 times I've had cars just sail through, completely oblivious. Note: they're sailing through on RED lights. Not amber going red. It's not one of those borderline cases.\nOnce I had a cop have a chat to me about jaywalking but I've never been fined. I would be pissed if I ever was. In a fight between a car and a pedestrian the pedestrian loses (big time) so pedestrians have a higher vested interest in their own safety. I know what the light changes are at intersections I cross a lot. Where are these cops when cars sail through red lights or nearly run over pedestrians when turning when the pedestrians have right of way?\nI get the distinct impression these skills will come in handy when I move to New York next month!\nAnyway, back to the self-driving cars: this I believe will be a painful transition that will take many, many years.

Now, as a \"born\" software engineer with a decent portfolio (now age 21) recently frustratated by a fruitless job search, turned down again and again (I believe rightfully so) because the competition all had college degrees, I beg to differ.\nA good college degree (especially in STEM fields) provide the basic foundation upon which to innovate. Our industries have gone so deep, and we are standing on such giant shoulders, that anyone who is going to take it further must first absorb the century or so of knowledge created so far on the subject.

{"prompt":"Over the last decade, the distributed system nature of modern server hardware internals has become painfully evident in how software architectures scale on a single machine. The traditional approaches -- multithreading, locking, lock-free structures, etc -- are all forms of coordination and agreement in a distributed system, with the attendant scalability problems if not used very carefully.\nAt some point several years ago, a few people noticed that if you attack the problem of scalable distribution within a single server the same way you would in large distributed systems (e.g. shared nothing architectures) that you could realize huge performance increases on a single machine. The caveat is that the software architectures look unorthodox.\nThe general model looks like this:\n- one process per core, each locked to a single core\n- use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA)\n- direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel)\n- direct storage I\/O (bypass kernel)\nIf you do it right, you minimize the amount of silicon that is shared between processes which has surprisingly large performance benefits. Linux has facilities that make this relatively straightforward too.\nAs a consequence, adjacent cores on the same CPU have only marginally more interaction with each other than cores on different machines entirely. Treating a single server as a distributed cluster of 1-core machines, and writing the software in such a way that the operating system behavior reflects that model to the extent possible, is a great architecture for extreme performance but you rarely see it outside of closed source software.\nAs a corollary, garbage-collected languages do not work for this at all.","completion":"> one process per core, each locked to a single core; use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA); direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel); direct storage I\/O (bypass kernel)\nI have no idea how to do any of these things.

{"prompt":"Copied from the other thread, because it bears repeating:\nI think it's important to keep in mind that the 12 vote margin is comfortable for Amash and supporters of new NSA restrictions and uncomfortable for its defenders.\nHere's why: opponents of Amash wielded an argument that \"split the vote\". Representatives who voted against Amash could have done so for one of two reasons:\n(1) They actively support providing the NSA with unchecked access to cell phone metadata under the \"business records\" provision of PATRIOT, or\n(2) They don't support that access, but can't support a broad amendment that potentially de-funds whole NSA programs, and instead need something finer grained to correct NSA with.\nMeanwhile, everyone who supported Amash believes strongly --- so strongly that they're willing to do something disruptive to NSA --- that new checks on NSA are needed.\n(I think Amash was a good amendment, if only because it  would force the House to do its actual job and carefully regulate intelligence collection; if it caused a temporary shitstorm, so much the better --- it'd be a well-deserved comeuppance for a legislature that has been derelict in its duty to oversee these programs.

{"prompt":"> Tesla are a sideshow and we desperately need to stop talking about them, because they're harming efforts to improve energy efficiency.\nCompletely disagree.  Tesla is, I think, unquestionably the most impactful company in the game, including GE and Nissan.  For two reasons.\nFirst, before Tesla people thought of electric vehicles as ridiculous DIY golf carts driven by treehuggers.  They were utterly uncool and stupid.  Post-Tesla, electric cars are among the very coolest cars in the world.  GE didn't do that.  Nissan didn't do that.  Toyota didn't do that.  Tesla did.  I think fundamentally changing people's perceptions of what an electric car is and what it can do is the single most impactful action in the industry so far.\nSecond, Tesla's critical product isn't their cars.  Their critical product is their battery technology.  It is second to none, in a business where the battery is everything.  This is the reason that both Daimler and Toyota have invested in the company.  I think you are seriously underestimating how important this is.\nAs to the article proper: it seems to me that running down your car is a pretty simple problem to engineer away.  This might be an issue, perhaps a burp that Tesla has to get fixed pronto.  But it's hardly, to use the breathless headline, devastating.","completion":"Their critical product is their battery technology.

{"prompt":"If Bitcoin ever graduates to anything more than a toy currency (last count was a billion or two USD globally?) then it's going to have to deal with graduate level problems.  The business cycle is a thing I'm afraid, and the management of a recession to prevent it's becoming a depression is as close to a fusion of science and art as you'll ever see.  The necessity for this isn't going to change as long as the human brain continues to function as it does.\nIn good times people want more money - a discussion on what they should want is irrelevant, lets stick to the facts - and in bad times people want to protect what they have (aggressively so).  Now consider that what makes times good vs bad is not determined by money - it's determined and prolonged by some other shock like an asset misvaluation, the destruction of a massive crop, or some combination of external factors underlying the real or nominal non-money thing.\nLet's say it's a rice crop.  Those dependent on rice freak out, and push all their money into safe assets, those dependent on those dependent on rice do the same.  The chain reaction continues until all the economy's money is tied up in safe assets, not being spent, and everyone is sat at home waiting for it to blow over.  If policymakers do not intervene correctly at this point, this situation will become a depression, and much misery will ensue.\nSo what do we do?  We make safe assets more expensive to lower the risk\/reward ratio for commercial activities: we make bank holdings very unrewarding (lower interest rates), we devalue the money in circulation and provide liquidity in one move (print money), and government invests in big infrastructure (liquidity, jobs, momentum, signalling etc).  All of this is designed to keep things moving and ward off a depression.  And it works - this is why we abandoned the gold standard.\nSo given that Bitcoin means nothing to rice, or most other external factors, and not to the rigidities that exacerbate recessions - how exactly do we deal with this in the described autonomous utopia?\nI very much agree that the regulators of currency leave a tremendous amount to be desired, but unfortunately this appears to be one of very few economic problems where decentralisation is not the answer.","completion":"Consider that with bitcoin the \"safest\" asset is also the most liquid (easiest to exchange)."}

You especially wouldn't let the janitor have an equal say - he's got no experience in desiging such things!\nI'm always very uneasy about equality talks because all people are not equally suited to make global policy decisions. Nor are they equally incentivized to make the most informed and rational decisions.\nI'm not saying that there isn't a problem or that we shouldn't do anything about it, but I am saying that I disagree with an egalitarian approach. We want the majority of decisions to be made by people who understand what they are deciding and have lots of experience, not to be made by individuals who mostly understand the topic from a single reddit thread.

Evil beats XVim hands down, but XVim is a lot better than the others I tried: IdeaVim (for Intellij), Vrapper (Vim for Eclipse), and Vintage (Vim for Sublime).

{"prompt":"Apple's \"Think Different \/ Change the World\" ad was a brilliant piece of marketing.  But it doesn't seem that really stuck as the core value of their brand.  If Nike's message is \"we hang around great athletes,\" Apple's message today is \"we hang around the young and hip,\" [1] which is different than \"we hang around people who change the world.\"\nYou could argue that these are somehow related, that the young and hip would be attracted by the Think Different ad.  I don't dispute that.  But the later ads of kids jamming with their iPod ear buds communicate a message that is much closer to the general perception of Apple as a brand today.\n--\n[1] In the clothing industry, this type of positioning wouldn't be noteworthy or distinguishing.  But in consumer electronics, advertising more like Abercrombie & Fitch and less like IBM has worked out brilliantly for them.\n[2] The pre-2000 perception of Apple's brand was also somewhat tangential to the idea of changing the world.  Their core message was \"we're not IBM.\"  In the talk, Jobs mentions this shouldn't be their core message, but clearly it was.  The 1984 ad reinforced this, and even the 1997 Think Different ad retrenched this ground by riffing off of IBM's motto.\n[3] Edit: The idea that Apple's core customer is someone who \"values their time\" and is not a computer geek is meaninglessly broad.  Every customer values his or her time, and in any mainstream industry, the vast majority of customers are not computer geeks.\n[4] Edit: Was it the success of the iPod that made Apple hip, or was the perception of the iPod being hip part of what made it such a success?  Clearly it did become a fashion accessory.  The product's clean design was congruent with this message.","completion":"we hang around the young and hip\nIs that not the same as Evian's slogan - live young, or pepsi's marketing way back to the younger people.

{"prompt":"Co-founder of Stack Overflow, here.\nA lot of the people who were involved in some way in Experts-Exchange don't understand Stack Overflow.\nThe basic value flow of EE is that \"experts\" provide valuable \"answers\" for novices with questions. In that equation there's one person asking a question and one person writing an answer.\nStack Overflow recognizes that for every person who asks a question, 100 - 10,000 people will type that same question into Google and find an answer that has already been written. In our equation, we are a community of people writing answers that will be read by hundreds or thousands of people. Ours is a project more like wikipedia -- collaboratively creating a resource for the Internet  at large.\nBecause that resource is provided by the community, it belongs to the community. That's why our data is freely available and licensed under creative commons. We did this specifically because of the negative experience we had with EE taking a community-generated resource and deciding to slap a paywall around it.\nThe attitude of many EE contributors, like Greg Young who calculates that he \"worked\" for half a year for free, is not shared by the 60,000 people who write answers on SO every month. When you talk to them you realize that on Stack Overflow, answering questions is about learning. It's about creating a permanent artifact to make the Internet better. It's about helping someone solve a problem in five minutes that would have taken them hours to solve on their own. It's not about working for free.\nAs soon as EE introduced the concept of money they forced everybody to think of their work on EE as just that -- work.","completion":"I come across at least two people every week wanting to learn how to program, instead of giving them a 500-page C book I tell them to go to SO and try to help someone, research on google a random subject\/question etc, then they start the reverse approach towards tools such as \"I think I know how to do this, but how can I run python on my computer?\" instead of installing 80GB of IDEs without knowing what they are for.\nThe results are amazing, they decide their favorite subjects without personal bias (a female friend got ultra hooked on SQL for example, even tho I hate it as a business language) and you just watch them fly.\nI also make sure to point out that the reputation is not a certification of authority or correctness, as I see they are just experience points, just how much you learned while being nice enough to share that experience.\nI am not a fan of the SE network splitting the subjects but understand why it exists right now, but I also think it is just an amazing problem to spend years on."}

{"prompt":"There is a very important question here: What is the relationship between you and the bank?\nUp until recently, it has been considered sacrosanct that deposit holders be protected, no matter the cost.  The convention and social contract has been that you deposit money for safe-keeping in a bank.  We have seen this over the past few years across both Europe and the US, as insolvent banks have been bailed-out, nationalised, given secret loans, so that deposit holders are wholly protected.\nWith Cyprus, this widely held belief is now in tatters.  You as a deposit holder are now a creditor of the bank.  As soon as you lend your money to the bank, it is no longer yours.  The bank will provide you with interest for the duration of the loan.  If the bank is no longer a going concern, you will no longer receive special treatment, but instead you must get in line with other creditors.\nSome may argue that this has always been the case[1], however it will be a genuine shock to many people, and any faith in deposit guarantee schemes has been dealt a severe blow when a week ago, the EU urged Cyprus to collectively punish all deposit holders regardless of balance.\n[1] For those in the UK, the House of Lords said in Foley v Hill 1848 http:\/\/www.uniset.ca\/other\/css\/9ER1002.html\n\"Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal... The money placed in custody of a banker is, to all intents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases... he is, of course, answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having received that money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid into his hands... the banker is not an agent or factor, but he is a debtor.\"","completion":"\"... the EU urged Cyprus to collectively punish all deposit holders regardless of balance.\"\nIs this true?

I have never got to the end of one.\nIf you need that much animation on a page to tell your story, isn't it a good sign that video might be more fit for purpose? Video was designed for storytelling, it will work on most devices, and it has well-established UI and conventions, such as a play button and progress bar.\nIf you're going to provide a play button in your scrollmation to automatically advance the action anyway, you've already recognised how irritating it is to manually page through an animated story by scrolling or swiping. So why then go to the trouble of creating a scroll-based animation that repurposes a 20+ year old convention and attempts to reinvent a tiny proportion of what video has to offer?\nIs it just for the novelty value?\nIs it because it makes you feel smarter?\nHow is it better for users trying to understand your story?\nI'd love to hear from anyone who's considered both video and scrollmation and chosen the latter.","completion":"> What motivates web designers to tell stories by repurposing the scroll mechanism instead of, say, using video?\nControl for the users."}

{"prompt":"Hi all. A few clarifications.\n- The meme that we are adding more and more features into the docker binary is unfounded. Please, please, I ask that before repeating it you do your homework and ask for actual examples. For example 1.4 is coming out next week: it has 500+ commits and basically no new features. It's all bugfixes, refactoring and a general focus on quality. That's going to be the trend from now on\n- Swarm and Machine are separate binaries. They are not part of the core docker runtime. You can use them in a completely orthogonal way.\n- Swarm follows the \"batteries included but removable\" principle. We are not doing all things to all people! There is a default scheduling backend but we want to make it swappable. In fact we had Mesosphere on stage today as part of a partnership to make Mesos a first-class backend.\n- there is an ongoing proposal to merge compose into the docker binary.

We may find that strange but if it helps with the adoption of Docker, then it benefits every Docker user and that's ok with me. On the other hand, it is definitely not popular on HN and has the opposite connotation of dorky pencil holder suit douchiness. Being from that tribe I share that instinctive reaction. But I also realize it's mostly psychological. I care less about the specific choice of words than the substance. And the substance here is that we launched a lot of new stuff today, and put a lot of effort in keeping the focus on a small, reliable runtime, composable tools which do one thing well, pluggability, open APIs, and playing nice with the ecosystem.

Just because you think there's something wrong with it, doesn't mean there is something wrong with it. I ran my own consumer electronics retail business for 5 years and about 70% of returns have absolutely nothing wrong with them. NewEgg can't just throw the stuff away, they'd go out of business.\nThey also can't just send the stuff to the manufacturer. The manufacturer doesn't care about your issues and if you return stock of which 70% is functional for warranty service, they will kick your ass.\nSo you hire guys to test the equipment and return it to sell-able condition and sell it as an open-box return.\nBack to our little problem. You bought a laptop. Great! You install Linux on it. Fine! Is it really that much trouble to return it to the same condition when you send it back?\nNewEgg has to hire guys who sit there for hours installing Windows from the non-existent install disks (they don't include those anymore ... you gotta download them) so that they can recoup their losses? It would cost them more than the laptop is worth.\nIf the laptop is truly defective, and you can't install the original operating system as a consequence, NewEgg has no quick means of determining what you did with the system ... and the manufacturer won't care either.\nSo if you buy a laptop and decide to return it, return it to factory condition.

Thinking that somehow this is what 'coding' is, is missing the point.\nI will read a stack overflow page perhaps in a search for some direction, look at all the 'solutions' like surveying a landscape of others approaches to the problem. Then I'll throw them all away and code my own. Possibly it will share a lot with one of the answers, what I would consider a good approach. But a literal copy and paste just doesn't happen. I would consider a copy and paste a recipe for inviting trouble, because you haven't really reasoned through the problem yourself, and thus don't really understand the solution intimately.\nProgramming is a process of mental reasoning around your problem with an eye on the form of reasoning computers use, so you can express that reasoning to the computer in the language you're using. Because computers don't reason like humans 'reason' (ie. humans don't really 'reason'...), knowing how a computer reasons and behaves is alien and takes time to understand and learn and it takes time to become quicker at comprehending this. This is the path of becoming a better programmer. Gaining that experience so the process is less alien and you more easily can fathom how a computer will respond and behave with a certain approach of laying out of the logic you are trying to express.\nCopy and paste doesn't help you at all with this.

{"prompt":"The problem with this article is that a lot of things that are cheap for one serving go stale before you eat the second.\nFor instance, on day one, he adds some mint which cost ~50p to buy, but he calls 1p because he only eats a little. He does not eat the rest of the mint that week, so it cost him ~50p, i.e. half the days budget.\nI am poor and eat very cheap. I do that using dry bulk foods and frozen veg. This is important because there are opportunities for free meals (e.g. if customers at work do not eat all the sand witches and biscuits, that can be lunch for 2 days). Friends invite you for dinner too. If you buy food that spoils, opportunities like this come at a price.\nHow about this for a suggestion - mix lentils, buck wheat, brown rice, dried beans, quinoa. These come in 500g bags for about a pound. You need 6 spoons of this mix per meal, so 10 pounds of mix will last you several months. Put in a rice cooker for 40 min (some beans need soaking first), with a chicken stock cube. Cook for 20 mins then add mixed frozen veg. This will cost you about 30p per meal, and is pretty much complete [1].\nI eat the above most of the time, and take free food whenever possible.

I know fifteen years ago I was making video calls over my GSM phone, chatting with people via SMS, AIM, and ICQ, etc.   Literally nothing in this post is in any way amazing to anyone who actually remembers life ten years ago.  We had smartphones.  We had social media.  We had web forums.  Just because you've dumped money into some of them doesn't make them special or even interesting from a technology standpoint.\nI, too, support SpaceX (as well as Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic, etc) but pretending that reddit is even anywhere near that list as far as being \"unimaginably fantastic\" is either depressingly credulous or else clumsy false optimism.\nSpecifically in computing, the past ten or fifteen years have been a war on general-purpose computing; all the brands names he's slinging around amount to a celebration of the black-boxing of internet services.  Ten years ago I could do all this stuff without needing a quad-core 2GHz phone to run a full-featured HTML5\/CSS\/JS browser platform.\nMore generally, in cars, computers, and most other sectors in technology, things are getting less and less accessible to casual interest or even moderately-dedicated hobbyists.  Sometimes it's in the name of efficiency, sometimes it's in the name of corporate control, but with the exception of the Tesla, everything he talks about existed ten years ago in some form.

{"prompt":"I worked at an Apple store for over a year as a \"salesperson\" (we called them Mac Specialists at the time). Let me input my two cents:\nI was trained to do this. From day one of dedicated 8-hour training sessions, we're trained to find customers the right \"solution\" rather than get the most money. This requires using the APPLE technique (acronym, google it). The second P stands for \"Present a solution for the customer to take home today.\" It was common knowledge at the time (4 years ago) that consumers were brainwashed to thinking faster\/more is always better. But when we can save them hundreds of dollars, this isn't the case. There were many many times I talked someone out of a $2,000 MacBook Pro for a $1200 entry-level iMac with double the specs because after probing (the first \"P\") I learned they didn't need to be mobile. This was really, really common.\nAnd note, this isn't about trying to convince people to spend less. Sometimes after probing, we learned they needed _more_. It is about the RIGHT solution.\nTo add to this: specialists don't earn commission. We weren't ranked based on financial sales numbers (there are other metrics, however). There is no incentive for specialists to sell more expensive or less expensive things. It is about the right thing.\nSo, this guy was just doing what he was trained to do. It is Apple store standard.","completion":"I agree that Apple, as the case is at every brick-and-mortar store that I'm loyal to (B&H Photo has often talked me out of expensive purchases), has a great incentive to not oversell an unneeded product.\nHowever, I think we need more data on recommendations before we can argue that the intent is entirely altruistic. As others have said, the low-end model is also the same model as the \"Vanilla\" build, i.e. the model that Apple has plenty of in stock...and a purchase in-store (with the possibility of upselling on other accessories) is more valuable than a purchase from the web. If it's the case that Apple sells a disproportionate amount of its Vanilla stock in-store, then is it coincidence that the Vanilla stock happens to be the perfect fit for so many customers? How many slightly-upgraded (but not in-stock) models are customers convinced to buy...because there has to be at least a few customers for whom the MBP is not ideal, but a slightly upgraded MBA is needed.\nAnd if you want to be totally cynical, you could argue that Apple is ensuring that the customer returns in the nearer future by selling them a less future-proof model. Yes, customers have loyalty based on the reliability of the brand...but if the compassionate-sales-job is so effective, then that alone may be good enough of a memory for the customer to overlook that he\/she is replacing a new laptop a year earlier than expected."}

Actually I think that many people like the idea of their posts are being read by as many people as possible and not just the ones with similar interests. Although it looks like a big discussion group, the news feed is really a giant personality-defining display for vain people.

I have the feeling that most really don't care very much. But ironically, I think the privacy-thing could actually work in facebook's favor. Here is why: I use fb a lot even though I don't like their privacy policies. I trust google more than facebook. Still, it bothers me when it says \"logged in\" in the google bar at the top because google watches my searches. When I am on facebook I behave like I am in public. I don't hope for the best and write secret stuff anywhere.

And god forbid you talk about your emotions...that's a female thing.\nBut the thing is, those activities are what allow us to be vulnerable and what allow us to bond with others. The more you suppress those urges, the more you end up feeling alone.

{"prompt":"Oh for heavens' sakes. Yet more ignorance.\nA more realistic view of C:\n- C is straightforward to compile into fast machine code...on a PDP-11. Its virtual machine does not match modern architectures very well, and its explicitness about details of its machine mean FORTRAN compilers typically produce faster code. The C virtual machine does not provide an accurate model of why your code is fast on a modern machine. The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development (go look at the Burroughs systems, or the Connection Machine, and tell me how well C's virtual machine maps to them).\n- C's standard library is a joke. Its shortcomings, particularly around string handling, have been responsible for an appalling fraction of the security holes of the past forty years.\n- C's tooling is hardly something to brag about, especially compared to its contemporaries like Smalltalk and Lisp. Most of the debuggers people use with C are command line monstrosities. Compare them to the standard debuggers of, say, Squeak or Allegro Common Lisp.\n- Claiming a fast build\/debug\/run cycle for C is sad. It seems fast because of the failure in this area of C++. Go look at Turbo Pascal if you want to know how to make the build\/debug\/run cycle fast.\n- Claiming that C is callable from anywhere via its standard ABI equates all the world with Unix. Sadly, that's almost true today, though, but maybe it's because of the ubiquity of C rather than the other way around.\nSo, before writing about the glories of C, please go familiarize yourself with modern FORTRAN, ALGOL 60 and 68, Turbo Pascal's compiler and environment, a good Smalltalk like Squeak or Pharo, and the state of modern pipelines processor architectures.","completion":"> The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development\nthe idea that specific requirements of c had started driving architecture development blew my mind the first time i came across it. it is still a point that does not get discussed nearly enough at a popular level."}

Unfortunately, the philosophy course seemed deeply rooted in classical theories like dualism (which I think of as a rationalization for religious dogma), ignoring any and all modern advances in neuroscience. The final straw was the lecture unit on \"artificial minds\". There was a lot of uninformed speculation about AI, which really disappointed me.

The places that were bartering were doing so because it was some low hanging fruit way to increase business and it was easy to to. And they were places that weren't particularly popular on their own (restaurants let's say) so they would do bartering to bring in customers on Monday nights but not allow it for obvious reasons on Saturday or Friday night.  There is always a feeling on the part of small business owners that barter dollars are not real dollars (even though there is value in many cases) and barter business is not real business.  A place that isn't doing that well to begin with (and once again I realize this is a generalization that is not true in many cases) is not going to have the best employees or the best attitudes because they are running short on cash and can't pay the best wages or have the best working conditions. So it's an entire ecosystem of mediocrity that you (in your case or me in my case) might end up experiencing.\nSo I guess in theory someone taking groupon (or barter dollars) should just be a regular business that is doing well wanting to increase business. But in actual cases it might more often (from my experience at least) be a marginal business that is trying to fix a situation with marketing that isn't exactly going to work as planned by bringing in groupon dollars or barter dollars (that will end up being used by the owner to go out to dinner with his wife (and yes that is what happened)). Valuable things (in the case of barter dollars) that a business needs are not typically available with barter dollars. What you get is a bunch of things like dining, travel or accountants or attorneys (and how many of those do you need)."}

And it will cost a bit more than $200 (though the Nexus 5at $349 isn't too far off).\nOn the other hand, if you're fed up with your carrier and would like to switch, you're free to do so. I just did it with AT&T. Walked into a T-Mobile store, asked them to transfer our numbers. The next day I called AT&T and asked, \"how much do I owe for the ETF?\" I paid the $225\/phone (that's how fed up with AT&T I was) over the phone with AT&T. Wait a few days for their accounting system to catch up, go to the web page and enter the IMEI for both phones, and two days later the phones are unlocked. Slapped the T-Mobile SIMs into the iPhones and we were on the air.\nI just don't get the sentiment of \"unlock my free-with-contract phone two months into my contract, you bastards!\" It's not your phone.

Over time, service providers develop a relationship with their customers based on knowledge of that customer.  This knowledge helps inform how they provide and improve their service.

That's it. If it doesn't do that - it's useless.\nBitcoin incentivises hoarding - the opposite of value transmission - and that's the main reason it'll remain as nothing more than a mere speculative currency, like modern day tulips, and why it won't ever become an actual alternative to actual cash.\nNow - this isn't a knock against crypto-currencies - which are awesome - it's merely a knock at the fact that monetary supply in the bitcoin system isn't adaptive. Bitcoin needs a central decentralized bank that will help to stabilise the system and inflate (punish hoarders) as the economy grows in fits and starts.\nI'm sure that one day in the not too distant future, another crypto-currency will come about that takes all the advantages provided by bitcoin, and combines them with stability\/incentives of a nation-backed currency such as the US dollar. When that happens, we can finally end the monopoly held by large financial institutions that so clearly have literally no idea what they are actually doing (see Deutsche bank just recently).\nBitcoins are just the beginning of a whole new financial world, free from restriction, fees and abuse (hopefully :).\nBut they most certainly are not the end.","completion":"Additional issues with bitcoin include significant and growing implementation complexity, legal environs, and latency."}

Google isn't the Oracle of the world where Oracle releases a product, charges you out the wazoo, gives you 24\/7 support and only enter the market of said product after researching if it is a good business investment or not. Google is the one who experiments, tests, lets you use for free, and either retires or promotes projects which turn out to be good for the company (either tech wise, or to the dismay of HN money wise). That's their MO.\nGoogle and Facebook allow you to export your data for most of their services, and I think we can all agree that Google at least are good at giving users a fair amount of heads up before they sunset a product (or should we call it an experiment?).\nIt seems the prevailing notion on HN anymore is once you are a big company (bad), any service you offer the internet no matter how long ago, should be kept around indefinitely, because you are a big company (bad) and you now make a lot of money (bad). Therefore you should let everyone free ride on your platform so that fellow (broke) startups can bootstrap themselves off your prior work (good).

{"prompt":"Ok, there's a lot to cover here.\nFirst off, the Apache Software Foundation isn't trying to absorb anyone or anything. Projects and people come to the ASF. It's a specific policy of the Foundation to NOT solicit projects. If someone says they're representing Apache and soliciting projects, they're wrong.\nSecondly, Apache is very opinionated about how projects should be run. This comes from years of experience as not only a successful project, but as a successful non-profit organization overseeing dozens of projects. If a community doesn't like the ASF's style or rules (such as no dictators, benevolent or otherwise), they don't need to be there. No one wants to keep projects hostage. Part of the point of the Incubator is to get this figured out earlier than later.\nThirdly, about git and subversion. First off, there's increasing support for git at Apache (see http:\/\/git.apache.org\/) but there are some serious drawbacks for use of git. Consider this: subversion was practically made for Apache in the way Linus made git for Linux. With that in mind, subversion isn't going anywhere at the ASF. Some of the rational is just plain stubbornness, but some of it goes straight to the core values of the Foundation.\nApache has become, for better or worse, the place where lots of projects go when they grow up. Growing up is hard to do. It's not fun. You have to do things like get a job, pay taxes, etc. When a project grows up, people start caring about who contributed what, under which license and making sure every line of code is legit. A lot of engineers don't care about this, but businesses and their lawyers do. A lot of the Apache Foundation \"bureaucracy\" is to handle this oversight and paperwork.\nGit is an impressive tool and github is awesome for what it is, but it's not a non-profit foundation and it won't replace one. Confusing the Apache Software Foundation for your coding sandbox only suggests you don't understand the true purpose of either.","completion":"what about Subversion goes \"straight to the core\" of the ASF that is not also true about git?"}

You simply can't drive all the conversations that happen about your company and product. If your success is determined by your necessity to drive the conversations, you're going to lose badly. The interview with PG notwithstanding, you have a company to run and marketing and sales to tackle -- the latter two of which are notoriously hard to control the conversation.\nI see the YCombinator interview as a minimal test - if you can pass that barrier, then you have a chance at possibly getting your customers to understand what you have and its value.

Well it is better than the PC, because I can lie down in bed, or on the couch, or on the front porch, or in the back-yard, or anywhere else for that matter, instead of sitting in a computer chair at a desk (I do that all day at work, why would I want to do it at home?). I prefer the touch-screen interface, and I like the fact there are many dedicated apps rather than just using a webpage. For example, I find browsing youtube using the Android app far more enjoyable than browsing it in a webpage. To me, the touchscreen is not just a convenient alternative to the mouse for tablet-style devices, it has ushered in a new paradigm for interacting with applications, it makes the UX that much better.\nIt is better than a phone, mainly because of screen size.

Make no mistake, this is as much a PR ploy by Tesla to pump up their offering.\nIt's incredibly smart for Musk and company to raise money in a very favorable environment as TSLA climbed from 45 to 90 after earnings. However, it remains to be seen if they can be still profitable. Note that they are still selling each car at a material loss; and only managed to show a profitable quarter by trading green credits they gained from their manufacturing. To truly scale, they need to either drive down the production cost of their cars down and broaden their market as there are only so much supply of carbon-emission credits on the market.\nDisclosure: I trade TSLA options on volatility, without any directional bias.","completion":"I'm looking at the 'Not Cool Dude' button."}

Naturally he was very involved in the process, but the decision was ultimately made by the board (which Sposato was not on). I can tell you that it was not an easy choice. \n3) Picnik was not a \"photo-sharing\" site, it was a photo editing site with very limited photo sharing.\n4) \"One-third of our 25-person team, including my two business partners, quit right off the bat\u201d.

So this time I played with React for about a month, then went to Angular (coincidently starting with React components and being an Angular virgin made me think of making everything isolated-scope directives in Angular).\nSo the problem for me was not React being bad or Angular better but at the end of the day it has to do with: As a non-fulltime webdev I need a _complete_ widget\/component library available for when I want to build my apps.  With React I felt like I was constantly either having to look for components that kind-of\/sort-of worked for me but had some short falls or I had to build them from scratch.  Then there's the look and feel so you're either looking for components that are Bootstrap ready or Material Design-ish, etc.  Even then, you take Angular Material: it's not there yet. Go to the website.  That side-nav menu they have going is really nice.  I wanted to use that in my app. Is that an MD component? Nope.  It's a hacked together mess of custom things. Talk about \"eating your own dog food\".\nIs this common place in the web world right now? Regardless of choosing React\/Angular\/whatever.  I mean I'm used to QT.  There's a widget for just about anything.  You just wire up your events and you have an app.  It seems like the web world is slowly just going to end up reinventing Delphi at the end of the day when I look at things like Polymer (why has it taken so long?)\nAll these frameworks are great but can we please just work on having feature-rich components\/widgets now.  And maybe keep them maintained for the next 5 years or so?","completion":"Unless you're working on a big project you should stick with Jquery \/ Jquery UI.

No amount of tech industry pr can facilitate a comeback from that. Almost half of the people in this country will always see Snowden as a traitor.\nGovernment surveillance has become a political wedge issue, similar to abortion. No one likes it or encourages it but people have strong emotions on both sides. Snowden is deserving of credit, he may have helped to spark another enduring and polarizing american social debate. It's unfortunate that he won't be around for the resulting legal process.\nIt's worth noting that the modern surveillance state didn't begin when Edward Snowden stepped in front of a camera for the first time. Where were these responsible tech giants five or ten years ago? When everyone in the country was flipping the heck out over 9\/11, some of these companies went along with the crowd and gave the government access to everything. Their points are very valid, more government transparency and accountability is always good. But courage is about doing the thing when it's hard, not when it's easy. It's good to see movement in the right direction but it would have been nice if things had gotten to this point sooner. Then maybe Snowden would still be sleeping in his own bed.","completion":"We got laws protecting whistleblowers of big corporations.

{"prompt":"When I was in college, one CS professor explained the difficulty of coding to me in terms of discreteness vs continuity. In the real world, things are continuous. If you accidentally build your structure with 9 supports instead of 10, then you only lose 10% of the strength of the structure, more or less. The strength varies continuously with the amount of support. But if you're writing a 10-line program and you forget one of the lines (or even one character), the program isn't 10% wrong, it's 100% wrong. (For example, instead of compiling and running correctly, it doesn't compile at all. Completely different results.)\nOf course this logic doesn't hold up all the time. Sometimes you can remove a critical support and collapse a structure, and sometimes removing a line of code has little to no effect, but the point is that in programming, a small change can have an unboundedly large effect, which is the definition of discontinuity.\n(I believe it was this professor, who was my teacher for discrete math: http:\/\/www.cs.virginia.edu\/~jck\/ )","completion":"i say its \"brittle\" ...those words discrete and continuous dont really apply cleanly, though i understand the idea somewhat intuitively"}

If I found a good driver back in the day I would get his phone # and take him exclusively to the airport. Uber solved this with UberX and by having a wealth of seemingly skilled drivers that made it a true on demand service.

For frequent business travelers, finding the right place at the right price is awesome and I would usually try to stay at the same place and connect with people directly. AirBnB solved this with overwhelming demand for the service (the place I like may not always be available) and with their insurance policy and scheduling tools for renters.\nIn any event, I don't feel like HomeJoy failing is indiciative of a bubble in the On Demand economy.

Like any other new language, it's a new, strange thing to learn, there's new tools and a new compiler, and your team doesn't already know it.\nIn addition, CoffeeScript has it's own distinct burden to bear: the entire point is to compile (in as straightforward a fashion as we can manage) into JavaScript. That you're debugging JavaScript when you run CoffeeScript in production should be no surprise -- that's the point.

So, Chrome uses whatever encrypted storage the system provides to keep your passwords safe for a locked account.

Said bad guy can dump all your session cookies, grab your history, install malicious extension to intercept all your browsing activity, or install OS user account level monitoring software. My point is that once the bad guy got access to your account the game was lost, because there are just too many vectors for him to get what he wants.\nWe've also been repeatedly asked why we don't just support a master password or something similar, even if we don't believe it works. We've debated it over and over again, but the conclusion we always come to is that we don't want to provide users with a false sense of security, and encourage risky behavior. We want to be very clear that when you grant someone access to your OS user account, that they can get at everything.

Sell their home in SF (if they own), and buy a nicer\/roomier place in the new location.\nPhoenix in particular has a pretty thriving tech community, and a far better cost of living.

{"prompt":"This is an important article, but I doubt there will be a useful discussion of it here.\nThe developed world has incredible productive capacity. With 1% of the workforce in agriculture and 8% in manufacturing, the US produces as much stuff as China.  There are no significant shortages of any manufactured good anywhere in the developed world. Quality is pretty good across the board, too. This is unique in history.\nThat's great. But there's less productive work to go around. We're out of buying power. Labor is worth less because there's a labor glut. Our economic system can't cope with that.  On top of this, more of what most people can do is being automated, and for less money. Automation used to be expensive. Now, if a computer can do it, it will be far cheaper than a human.\nThe financial system has become primarily self-serving, running on self-generated zero-sum tasks.  It's part of the problem, not part of the solution.  If we had a capital shortage, that might be a problem. Instead, we have a capital glut, and no place to put it that produces good returns on investment.  This is \"secular stagnation\", as the article puts it.\nJapan hit this around 1989, when their real estate bubble collapsed.  Japan never came back from that.  There was hope that the Japanese would figure out something.  25 years later, they haven't. They've built up their safety net and put money into infrastructure projects, so that fewer people are suffering.  That's the best they could come up with.\nWe have no successful model for dealing with this.  What capitalism gives us by default is a small number of rich people and a large number of poor people competing for a shrinking pool of low-paying jobs.  Nobody really knows what to do about this, including the people who say they do.","completion":"Sorry, but the financial system exists at the behest of the political class. The political class is the one percent who runs it all. They may talk that we have a capitalist society but with the heavy amount of regulation that exists that is pretty much a stretch.

You thwart them and its pretty damn sure within a few short years what you do is illegal or your paying off through someone's campaign.\nShovel ready jobs, the ACA, none of this was done to benefit the everyday worker, their employment or fulfillment were not part of the equation."}

Leave your stuff there to claim the seat. Then go back to the 1st floor counter, order and get your drinks\/food, wait to receive them, walk back to your stuff.\nThe point you should get from this is that PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY SUCK AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED YOU LIVE IN SUCH A SHITTY CULTURE AND THAT YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR STUFF BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL STEAL IT.\nAfter living in a country with very little violence, a country where you don't have to pull your car radio out of your car, where you don't have worry about what alleys you walk down, a country where if you leave your bags or wallet on a train you'll get them back, I was very ashamed of my own country, the USA, where I used to think I was safe but in reality I'd just learned to avoid the ever present danger rather than do something to fix it.\nNow comes all the replies telling me how much Japan sucks in other ways.

Boom, brand loyalty is gone, nobody would go to their \"favourite\" store any more because there would be no favourites.\nYes, big stores like walmart and competitors compete on $0.01 (and openly advertise that they're $0.01 cheaper) but any store that isn't providing grocery type items doesn't, although maybe England is unique and in America it's different?

{"prompt":"Can you argue that there is ever a social (not private) benefit to NOT open sourcing your code?","completion":"A lot of serious security advisories affecting closed source programs often don't become exploits in the wild due to the nature of closed source and the impied secrecy involved.\nFor example, IE had a major, major issue regarding SChannel that more or less trivially gave attackers an ability to run arbitary code at either admin or SYSTEM level. It was scary. It was reported privately and then patched.  Never in this process did anyone have the source code to analyze and publish an early PoC like they did shellshock and heartbleed. When the patch was released, it was a binary, so no one could just compare the old code to the new and figure out exactly what the problem was and launch an attack. Sure, they could analyze the binary, but that gives limited and often unusable results. Or at the very least puts up enough barriers to buy time for patch installs.\nIts funny, years ago we used to worry about our Windows servers, now only worry about our linux servers. FOSS's transparency is ugly when it comes to exploits because they go from discovered to in the wild very, very quickly. Even when they don't, once the patch is released, the hackers have the exploit instantly, and that means if your organization can't patch for a couple hours, you're screwed. The recent Drupal exploit is a good example of this. It went from published to bots hacking Drupal installs within seven hours. Millions of sites were affected."}
